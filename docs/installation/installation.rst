Installation
============

When you have properly downloaded source codes, you can now proceed with installation. You can use
already created ``setup.py`` file to make this really simple. Before installation, I really recommend to setup new Python
virtual environment if you have not done this yet. You can find information about how to do in :doc:`virtualenv`.

First navigate to the root directory of the **spectra-downloader** tool. ``setup.py`` file should be in this directory too. Now
you can invoke installation process by calling::

    python3 setup.py install
